This is a command line blackjack game coded in Eclipse for a C++ class at Queens College. 
It allows multiple players to play the game.

A few simple requirements stablished by the professor:

- The dealer hits while his hand is less than 17
- Each player's initial score is zero
- For each win against the dealer, a player gets 1 score point
- For each bust or loss against the dealer, a player loses 1 score point
- For each push/tie against the dealer, the player does not win or lose score points,
    while other players not holding a blackjack, lose 1 score point
